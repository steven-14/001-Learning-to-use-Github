INSTALL GIT
If you have IOS or Linux Git should be installed.
If you have windows then you need to install it.
Use this tutorial to install Git on windows:
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows 
For the windows installation, when you download and install it,
Gwen recommends choose the Git bash option from the install menu.
Because Bash is portable,has more features than cmd, servers use bash (because Unix/Linux), 
and because Git tutorials are written in bash.
